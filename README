This is my workplace for my program code in fedora(linux). 
I will learn how to write program in linux using VIM, and want to do something coding which can run in linux.
Also I want to learn some program Languages like Lisp, Python, C++, Ruby, Shell, and so on.
After maybe 1 year, I will goto find jobs, and I hope I could find a good job.
